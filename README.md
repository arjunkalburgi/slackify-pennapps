### Introduction

*Read the full introduction on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/arjunkalburgi/an-app-for-team-bonding-through-slack-7b9022dabc95)!*

Slackify is an Expo app that allows users to choose/take photos which then get resized to emoji dimensions perfect for uploading to Slack. With this app, a team can quickly grow their custom emoji index with all manner of photos.

With Slackify, I placed in the top 30 at PennApps 2017! 

### Hackathon Presentation

### Philadelphia Trip Vlog 

I vlogged my trip to Philadelphia for this hackathon, [check it out on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hseg7avgAWk&t=171s)!

### Build/Run Instructions 

Follow these instructions from the Expo documentation, but instead of creating a new project, select slackify (you must clone the repo of course)
